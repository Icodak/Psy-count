        <p>Information that affects our health is personal. As such, they must be protected with the greatest care. </br>
        Respect for privacy is a fundamental right and one of the core values of PSY-FI.
             PSY-FI undertakes to comply with French and European regulations on the protection of
             personal data, in particular the General Data Protection Regulation (EU)
             of April 27, 2016 (“RGPD”) and the Data Protection Act of January 6, 1978 (“LIL”). </br>
             We work with the authorities in charge of data protection, at European level
             and for each country where we are established, with the public actors responsible for
             the organization of the health system, as well as with all patient representatives,
             professionals and healthcare institutions, to ensure that we comply with
             all of our legal obligations regarding the protection of personal data of
             health.</br>
             PSY-FI has a team dedicated to the protection of personal data,
             including in particular a Data Protection Officer declared to the CNIL, a
             security team, a legal team and engineers specializing in the protection of
             data.</br>
             Personal data (including health) of patients who use the services
             of PSY-FI are hosted by a physical infrastructure host and outsourcer having received
             HDS certification (Health Data Host).</br>

             personal health character of its users, you can consult our Charter of

        <h2>PURPOSES AND PROCESSING OF CHARACTER DATA
             STAFF COLLECTED</h2>

        <h2>1. Need for collection</h2>

        <p>When using the Platform, the User communicates certain Data to PSY-FI to
             personal character necessary for the provision of the requested Service. If the User does not wish
             not communicate the information requested, or oppose their use by
             PSY-FI, the User may not be able to access certain parts of the Site or
             Services and that PSY-FI is unable to meet its request.</p>

        <p>All Personal Data collected is processed and stored for a period of
             limited according to the purpose of the processing and the legislation applicable to the Services.
             PSY-FI determines the retention periods for Personal Data only
             in his capacity as Data Controller. As part of the treatments carried out in quality
             as a Subcontractor, PSY-FI acts only on the instructions of the Data Controllers and does not
             not itself determine the retention period of Personal Data.

             for which PSY-FI is only a Subcontractor, we recommend that you contact
             directly to your Healthcare Actor, Data Controller.</br>
             At the end of the retention periods, the Users' personal data are permanently deleted or anonymized.</br>
             Given the legal archiving obligations imposed on Health Actors, they are
             likely to keep, on their own tools, the Personal Data of
             Users for periods longer than those indicated below in order to ensure
             Patients medical monitoring and optimal care.</p>
